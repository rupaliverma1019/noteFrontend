export default NoteContext;


// import { createContext } from 'react';: This line imports the createContext function from the 'react' module. The createContext function is a built-in function provided by React that allows you to create a new context object.

// const NoteContext = createContext();: This line creates a new context object using the createContext function. The context object (NoteContext in this case) acts as a container for the state and functions that you want to share and make accessible to multiple components in your application. The createContext function returns an object with two properties: Provider and Consumer, which you can use to provide and consume the context data.


// Overall, this code sets up a context called NoteContext that can be used to manage and share state between components in your React application. Other components can use the Provider and Consumer components associated with this context to access and update data that you provide through the context.
